## Personal Information
- Name: Fiona

## Question
Discuss in the README.md why phpinfo.php behaves the way it does when loaded through Node.JS (4 points)
- Since Node.JS is a JavaScript runtime environment, and it cannot execute PHP code on its own. To be specific, Node.JS can recognize the .txt, .html, and .jpg, etc, files, but it can not recognize phpinfo.php.
